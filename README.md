This repository hosts the source code for the GitHub Pages site that embeds the JZ 2025
Figma prototype.

## Local development

You can preview the page locally with any static file server. For example, using Python:

```bash
python3 -m http.server
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000> in your browser to view the site.

## Deployment

Push changes to the `main` branch (or the branch configured for GitHub Pages) to update the
live site.
